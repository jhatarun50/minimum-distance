The distance between two array values is the number of indices between them. Given , find the minimum distance between any pair of equal elements in the array. If no such value exists, return .

Example

There are two matching pairs of values:  and . The indices of the 's are  and , so their distance is . The indices of the 's are  and , so their distance is . The minimum distance is .
Print a single integer denoting the minimum  in . If no such value exists, print .
